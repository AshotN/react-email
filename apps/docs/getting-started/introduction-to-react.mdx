Lots of users come to React Email from other setups and from not knowing
how React operates on the basics. This is meant to be a good guide
so that users can get the understanding they need to just use React Email.

## What is JSX?

JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript, it is meant so that developers can
write what seems like just HTML but in JavaScript itself. JSX is not native to
Node, but it is native to [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/jsx) and
[Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/advanced/jsx_dom/jsx/).

Under the hood, React converts the HTML tags into function calls. Here's an example:

```jsx
<Html>
    <Head/>

    <Tailwind>
        <Body>
            ...
        </Body>
    </Tailwind>
</Html>
```

Would represent:

```js
React.createElement(Html, { }, [
    React.createElement(Head, { }),
    React.createElement(
        Tailwind, 
        { }, 
        React.createElement(Body, {}, `...`)
    )
]);
```

This means that all elements get converted into simple function calls. These function calls
end up returning just a simple object that is later on used by React Email to be converted into HTML.
This means that a simple element, such as `<div>Hello world!</div>` becomes the following JSON:

```json
{
    "type": "div",
    "props": {},
    "children": "Hello world!"
}
```

## What can I use as the build step?

From the last section the only conclusion is that we need a build step, at least when using Node,
for JSX to actually work properly.

If you are using TypeScript, `tsc` should already work just fine. You just need to add the following
to your `tsconfig.json`:

```diff
 }
     ...
     "compilerOptions": {
+        "jsx": "react-jsx"
     }
 {
```

Along with this, you also will need to have `@types/react` installed so that TypeScript can figure
the types out properly.

If you are not using `tsc` and instead just directly run your code with `node
...`, you will need to get some build tool setup. Among these the one we
recommend the most is the amazing [tsup](https://github.com/egoist/tsup) but ran as
[tsup-node](https://tsup.egoist.dev/#excluding-all-packages).

Some other build tool options include:
- [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)
- [babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild)
